This folder contains speech files and their time- and pitch-scaled versions used for conducting perceptual evaluation of ESOLA algorithm. Three sentences were chosen from the CMU-Arctic database for the evaluation.


There are three folders: 
1. Original_speech_files: Contains original speech files used for the evaluation.
1. TSM: Time-scale modified speech files for each of the three chosen sentences (arranged again in the form of subfolders named Set1, Set2, and Set3). 
2. PSM: Pitch-scale modified speech files for each of the three chosen sentences (arranged again in the form of subfolders named Set1, Set2, and Set3).

HTML files:
The speech files used for perceptual evaluation are embedded in the following html files: 'Set1.html,' 'Set2.html,' and 'Set3.html' to provide the listener with an user-interface to play, pause, and stop the speech files. 

Please use the latest Google Chrome web browser to launch these files.

The file 'Instructions_to_Listeners.doc' contains instructions given to listeners before the perceptual evaluation test. A listener would listen to the speech files of various techniques for a particular scale factor, and then enter the ratings in an xls sheet. 


In order to remove any bias during the listening test, the time- and pitch-scaled speech files of various techniques are presented in different orders for different scaling factors. The file 'Order_of_Techniques.doc' contains the order in which the time- and pitch-scaled files are presented to the listeners for different scaling factors. Of course, the listener was not aware of this ordering.
