This folder contains speech files and their time- and pitch-scaled versions. There are two folders: 
1. TSM: time-scale modification 
2. PSM: pitch-scale modification

As the name indicates, the folders contain time- and pitch-scaled files. 

Naming convention for files: 'name_factor_method.wav'
name - name of the speech file
factor - time or pitch scaling factor
method - could be ETS or EPS (ETS: ESOLA time-scale modification, EPS: ESOLA pitch-scale modification)
Examples: 
'hindi_0p75_ETS.wav' is the time-scaled version of the speech file 'hindi.wav' with the time-scaling factor 0.75.
'hindi_1p5_EPS.wav' is the pitch-scaled version of the speech file 'hindi.wav' with the pitch-scaling factor 1.5.

The original speech files do not contain 'factor' and 'method' attributes.

Presentation: The pptx file 'ESOLA_Demo.ppt' contains all these speech files arranged in the form of tables for easier evaluation. 
Note: The speech files may take some time to load when the ppt is in the presentation mode. It is advised to listen to the speech files without viewing the ppt file in the presentation mode.
