1. TSM: time-scale modification 
2. PSM: pitch-scale modification

As the name indicates, the folders contain time- and pitch-scaled files. 

Naming convention for files: 'name_factor_method.wav'
name - name of the speech file
factor - time or pitch scaling factor
method - could be ETS or EPS (ETS: ESOLA time-scale modification, EPS: ESOLA pitch-scale modification)
Examples: 
'hindi_0p75_ETS.wav' is the time-scaled version of the speech file 'hindi.wav' with the time-scaling factor 0.75.
'hindi_1p5_EPS.wav' is the pitch-scaled version of the speech file 'hindi.wav' with the pitch-scaling factor 1.5.
