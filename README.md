This is the repository for the codes, demo speech files, perceptual evaluation speech files corresponding to the Epoch-Synchronous Overlap-Add (ESOLA) time- and pitch-scale modification of speech signals. 

The results of the ESOLA technique can be found on the webpage: https://iisceespectrumlab.wixsite.com/esola

If you use any codes in this repository, please consider citing the following paper:

S. Rudresh, A. Vasisht, K. Vijayan, and C. S. Seelamantula, "Epoch-Synchronous Overlap-Add (ESOLA) time- and pitch-scale modification of speech signals," arXiv: 1801.06492, 2018. Available online: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06492 


1. Each folder has a "README.txt" file that gives information about the contents of the respective folder.
2. In order to listen to the time- and pitch-scaled speech signals produced by the ESOLA technique, please refer to the presentation "ESOLA_Demo.ppt" in the folder 'ESOLA_Results_Speech_Files.' The same speech files are put up on the webpage https://iisceespectrumlab.wixsite.com/esola
